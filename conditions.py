# Python functions can be defined with named arguments which may have 
# default values provided. When function arguments are passed using their names, 
# they are referred to as keyword arguments. The use of keyword arguments when calling a 
# function allows the arguments to be passed in any order â€” not just the order that they were defined 
# in the function. If the function is invoked without a value for a specific argument, the default value will be used.
